# NoteVenture

This project will be a game similar to the older, top-down "The Legend of Zelda" games.

Right now I'm making a single section of the full
dungeon, but later I want to make the entire
dungeon structure that I had designed.

The goal (for now) is to clear rooms in the dungeon and get the the
MacGuffin at the end.

## Motivation

I tried to make this project on a different platform before and 
it did not work out since I was doing other school and personal 
projects at the time. This one fell on the back burner, but I liked 
the idea.

Since it's relatively simple but requires me writing functionality that
I haven't done before, I want to make it to learn how to do that.

It will require a lot more DOM manipulation since I'll be dynamically adding and removing HTML elements and, in addition to that, I will need to learn how to do:
- Collision detection, 
- Frame-based input detection,
- Hitbox-hurtbox detection/interactions and 
- Using keyframes for animations.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Credits
- Me and only me for right now
