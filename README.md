# Slime Dungeon

This project is a top-down, "The Legend of Zelda" type game where you go through an endless dungeon and defeat slimes.

The goal (for now) is to clear as many rooms as possible.

Some issues:
- Game runs slow
- Collision is very buggy

## Motivation

I tried to make this project on a different platform before and 
it did not work out since I was doing other school and personal 
projects at the time. This one fell on the back burner, but I liked 
the idea.

Since it's relatively simple but requires me writing functionality that
I haven't done before, I want to make it to learn how to do that.

However, I realized I would not meet the deadline so it has been downscaled to what you see now.

Doing this project allowed me to learn he basics of
- DOM manipulation 
- Dynamically adding and removing HTML elements
- Collision detection, 
- Frame-based input detection,
- Hitbox-hurtbox detection/interactions and 
- Using keyframes for animations.

## Technologies
- HTML (without canvas tags)
- CSS
- JS
