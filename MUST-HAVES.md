If you build a you Game must have:

1. **Must be a two player game** (either against the computer or against another player)
    - For my game, there will be the player and there will be AI controlled enemies.

2. **A win state**
    - The use wins when they interact with the MacGuffin.

3. **A lose state**
    - The user loses if they lose all their health.

4. **A way to keep playing if the game is not over**
    - I plan for the game to run in a gameLoop, so it will run indefinably. 
  
5. **Multiple rounds to play** 
    - The part IDK about yet.
    - Maybe have the rooms lock and only unlock once all enemies are defeated. This could serve as a round for the player before they move to the next room.

<!-- 
- a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost

- Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer - the player's hand can either win, lose or tie the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll - Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (vertically or horizontally)- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case
