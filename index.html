  <!-- Dev Notes for Readers:
    - If you see any special characters in comments, I use them to color comments so that different sections are easier to find
    
    - I'm starting with stuff that can make a bigger game, but it's just so I can scale it later if need be. 
      What I'll be making for the project will probably have 2 enemy types and 3 rooms.
